# React Todo Application

A simple React Todo application that allows users to manage their tasks with features like adding, updating, deleting, and toggling task completion. The app also persists the Todo list using `localStorage`.

## Features

- Add new tasks.
- Update existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- Toggle task completion (Mark tasks as completed or pending).
- Data is persisted across page reloads using `localStorage`.

## Tech Stack

- React
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Context API for state management

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamalibinsaeed/react-todo-hooks.git
   cd react-todo-hooks
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## File Structure

- `src/`
  - `components/`
    - `TodoForm.js`: Form to add new todos.
    - `TodoItem.js`: Displays individual todo items.
  - `contexts/`
    - `TodoContext.js`: Context API for managing the todo state.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `App.css`: Basic styling for the app.

## How it Works

- **App Component (`App.js`)**: Manages the state for the list of todos using the `useState` hook. It contains functions to add, update, delete, and toggle the completion of todos. 
- **TodoProvider (`TodoContext.js`)**: Provides the todo state and the functions to manipulate it across the app using React Context.
- **LocalStorage**: Todos are stored in `localStorage` to persist data across page reloads. When the app loads, it checks if there are any saved todos in `localStorage` and loads them.

### Components

- **TodoForm**: A form where users can add new todos. 
- **TodoItem**: Represents a single todo item with its details and an option to toggle its completion.
